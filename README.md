There are 3 configuration variations of the node. Each configuration serves a different need of the node:

[Public Node only]    |Contains only the public node. This configuration can be used for mining 
[Anchor Node]         |Contains both the public node and the anchoring service. This configuration can be used for the anchoring of hashes of the public LTO chain 
**Full Node**         |Contains all services. This configuration can used to run decentralized workflows

## TestNet
 
If you wish to start testing with our testnet. Please create a wallet on: [https://testnet-wallet.lto.network](https://testnet-wallet.lto.network)
 
Send you address to our [support](mailto:support@legalthings.io) so we will deposit some LTO for testing on the testnet. Or request your tokens via our [telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/AJWQTUDKtDlsuGHVFb40eQ) channel.
 
To view all the transactions on the testnet you can check out our explorer on: [https://testnet-explorer.lto.network](https://testnet-explorer.lto.network)
 
## Mainnet
 
For mainnet you will have to buy tokens. You can then use these tokens by sending them to the wallet you will link to your node.
 
The wallet can be found here: [https://wallet.lto.network](https://wallet.lto.network)
